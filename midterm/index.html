    <h2> About Tucker</h2> 

</p>

<p>
    To start off, Tucker is a lovable and sweet dog who if it weren't for his big size. Would be a perfect lap dog. When on two feet standing up, he is almost 5 feet.
    Tucker is almost 2 years old in dog years but in human years he would be around 24 years old. Ever since he was a puppy, hes always been so quiet and never was
    blood curling loud. Only he ever barks is at the window when nothing is there, this is his way of being a guard dog but yet, he's scared of water. One of his favourite 
    foods is turkey, only because when he had to take medicine, he would be given turkey to hide it. This caused an obsession with turkey and its fine until the holidays come
    rolling by. Another thing he does like eating and weve had to hide it, is butter. Once he got to a certain age, he was able to reach the counters. Which meant he could
    also reach the butter perfectly placed for him to eat. So eventually we had to hide it from him.
